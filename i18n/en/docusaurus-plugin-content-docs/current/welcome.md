# Welcome to Content Authenticity

## Overview

We live in a digital age overflowing with AI-generated content and deepfakes. The spread of fake news, copyright disputes over AI-generated works, privacy-invading digital crimes, and a surge in image and video forgery have intensified the confusion about **which content to trust**.

DigiCAP's **Content Authenticity service** was developed to solve these problems.

:::info Core Technology
By combining **C2PA standard-based digital signatures (X.509 certificates)** and **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)-based deep learning Fingerprinting technology**, we verify the provenance and integrity of image and video content in real-time.

## Service Features

DigiCAP's Content Authenticity service offers the following features:

- **üîê Digital Signature-based Authentication**: Ensures content integrity with X.509 certificates compliant with the C2PA standard.
- **üß† CNN-based Fingerprint Recognition**: Deep learning verification using unique Feature Vectors extracted from images and videos.
- **üîÑ End-to-end Tracking**: Automatically verifies the entire workflow from content creation to use and redistribution.
- **‚ö° Real-time Processing**: Fast and accurate real-time content verification.

## What is the C2PA Standard?

**C2PA** (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity) is an **open technical standard** for verifying the provenance and authenticity of digital content.

### Key Concepts

**Content Credentials**

- Securely records the history (provenance) of digital media from creation and editing to distribution.
- Allows for transparent tracking of content's origin and changes.

### The Need for C2PA

The following problems are escalating in the current digital environment:

| Problem                      | Description                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Spread of Misinformation** | Social chaos due to the rapid dissemination of manipulated content.        |
| **Copyright Infringement**   | Difficulty distinguishing between AI-generated works and original content. |
| **Decline in Trust**         | A general erosion of trust in digital media.                               |
| **Legal Disputes**           | Difficulty in proving the authenticity of content.                         |

### Challenges Addressed by C2PA

The C2PA open technical standard addresses these issues in the following ways:

1.  **Provides Transparent Provenance**: Clearly records the original source and modification history of digital content.
2.  **Identifies Manipulated Content**: Automatically detects intentionally altered content.
3.  **Protects Creator Rights**: Technically safeguards the intellectual property rights of content creators.
4.  **Restores Media Trust**: Enhances the credibility of digital media through verifiable content.
